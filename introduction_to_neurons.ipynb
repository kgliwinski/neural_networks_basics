    "Neurons gather signals from predecessors (other neurons) - they can travel with different speeds, so we will call them **weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When signals get into the neuron (sum) and multiplied by weights they will reach some treshold, the neuron will send signal further.\n",

    "The idea of machine learning is the model learns through examples. It can be treated as a black box - from some input it will return output based on the model learning data.\n",
